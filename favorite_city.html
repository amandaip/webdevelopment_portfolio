    <h3 id="subtitle">Description</h3>
    <p id="p1n3">Australia has 6 states, including New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia, and Tasmania. Brisbane is the capital of and the most populated city in the state of Queensland, Australia. Here you can find art, food, views, wild animals and other entertainment. My favorite food is fish and chips, which is a popular and hot dish in Australia. Let me plan you a one-day trip here. In the morning, you can go to a street beach to swim and enjoy sunbathing. In the afternoon, you can go to a zoo or sanctuary and interact with the famous Australian's wild animals, Koalas and Kangaroos. In the evening, you can take a ferry along the Brisbane river to enjoy the nice night views and commute to different places. At night time, you can visit some grand casino and find some luck on winning your flight ticket back. :) Let's go over some details below. </p>

      <p id="p2">Boat Pool is a street beach in the district of Parklands. It is worth to spend a whole day and evening there when it's open 24-hour with no cost. It is located somewhere in the middle of the city, where you can get drinks and food nearby. Maybe get some fish and chips after the boat pool?? <a href="https://www.visitbrisbane.com.au/south-bank/things-to-do/swimming-at-south-bank?sc_lang=en-au">Reference Link</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Unlike the United States, the regular malls and restaurants closes very early like 7pm, except for the bars and lounges. However, you can still walk around to enjoy the night by taking photos with buildings around the area. Sometimes you may see random arts on the street. Some churches' design are magnificent. You can also take the ferris wheel to look at the city of Brisbane from a high point. </p>

      <p id="p2">If you enjoy jogging or skateboarding, I recommend you to take a few hours to walk along the Brisbane River. Be relax and get some fresh air. It is a pet-friendly area, so you may see many people walk their dogs there as well. It may be a place for you to just get away from the bustling city for a moment. </p>
