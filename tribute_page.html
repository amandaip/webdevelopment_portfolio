        Tim Berners, also known as TimBL, who was born in 1955 and raised in London is an English engineer and computer scientist. His parents were also computer scientists, and they worked on one of the earliest computers. In his early life, he spent four years at Emanuel School in south west London  from 1969 to 1973 before enrolled at The Queen's College, Oxford from 1973 to 1976, where he obtained a first-class BA degree in physics. After graduation, Berners-Lee got hired as an engineer at the telecommunications company called Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1980, he became a software engineer at CERN. His best known invention was the World Wide Web.

      The invention of World Wide Web brought a game-changing moment to our next generation. At first Tim Berners-Lee proposed an information management system then implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet. By 1990, three fundamental technologies, such as HTML (makeup language), URI/URL (web address) and HTTP (internet's communication), were created and remained to be the foundation of today's web.
